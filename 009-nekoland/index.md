"Easter eggs" are hidden features or messages, inside jokes, and cultural
references inserted into media. Easter eggs in software are often hidden
messages or even features that require following a series of undocumented steps
to trigger and discover.

[Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_Atsume) is a
popular mobile game that revolves around the player purchasing food, cat toys
and furniture to attract a variety of cats to their home.

Android Nougat (version 7) included a game similar to Neko Atsume that allowed
the user to collect cats. The code snippet above belongs to the code of this
secret game.
