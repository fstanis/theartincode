Duff's device is a famous snippet of C code that manually performs [loop unrolling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loop-unrolling/).

Manually unrolling loops is nowadays considered a bad practice, as most
compilers perform this automatically behind the scenes.

However, the historical significance of Duff's device remains: it reminds us
that creativity can help us overcome limits introduced by abstraction created
in a higher level language (in this case C as opposed to assembly).
